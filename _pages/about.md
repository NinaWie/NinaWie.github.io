I'm a researcher in AI and GIS, excited about impactful applications of AI. I love to learn new things, which has led me to engage in a variety of projects ranging from Neuroscience, CV, Robotics, GIS, and discrete optimization. My background is in Cognitive Science (Uni Osnabrueck) and Data Science (ETH Zurich). Currently, I am pursuing PhD in GIS with a focus on mobility, where our aim is to develop computational methods for advancing sustainable transportation. At the moment, I'm interning at Intel Labs in a group working on 3D generation.

In my free time, I love to do sports and to go to the mountains for hiking, skiing, cycling, or paragliding. When the weather is bad, I work on some fun side projects.
