I am a researcher specializing in GeoAI and Computer Vision. I have a background in Cognitive Science (Uni Osnabrueck) and Data Science (ETH Zurich), but my curiosity to learn new things has led me to explore various fields, including Neuroscience, Computer Vision, Robotics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and discrete optimization. Currently, I am an AI research scientiest at Intel, but still hold a 10% position at ETH Zurich in the [MIE lab](https://mie-lab.ethz.ch/), a GIS group with a focus on human mobility where I did my PhD. 

In my free time, I love to do [sports](/hobbies/), especially to go to the mountains for hiking, skiing, cycling, or paragliding. When the weather is bad, I work on some fun [side projects](/projects).
