I am a researcher specializing in GeoAI and Computer Vision. I have a background in Cognitive Science (Uni Osnabrueck) and Data Science (ETH Zurich), but my curiosity to learn new things has led me to explore various fields, including Neuroscience, Computer Vision, Robotics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and discrete optimization. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in the [MIE lab](https://mie-lab.ethz.ch/), a GIS group with a focus on human mobility. Our goal is to develop computational methods for advancing sustainable transportation. I am also part-time employed at Intel in a group working on 3D generation, following a 6-month internship I did there in 2024.

In my free time, I love to do [sports](/hobbies/), especially to go to the mountains for hiking, skiing, cycling, or paragliding. When the weather is bad, I work on some fun [side projects](/projects).
