Early in the COVID pandemic, we wanted to help somehow and took part in a hackathon - this two day fun event turned into a four year project with a published [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/2/672) and a collaboration with a clinic in Maastricht, Netherlands. 

Our goal was to detect COVID-19 symptoms automatically from lung ultrasound videos. Ultrasound is cheaper than other imaging methods and faster than a PCR test, and can be useful also for monitoring the disease progression in the lung.
