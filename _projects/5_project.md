After I spend days on checking the availability of mountain huts one after another, each on their own website with five cross references until you reach the actual booking website, I was sufficiently annoyed to spend a night on scraping the website and making a small database of huts and their availabilities. Together with two friends, we are now developing a web app that shows the huts on the map and allows to filter by availability. Still WIP but we already got our hiking friends excited about it!
